    "    “Hello” + “ “ + “World” → “Hello World”\n",

    "   * has a *type* referred to as a **class**, analogous to “float” or “string”.\n",

    "   * holds *code* in form of **methods**.\n",

    "For example, lets say we want to keep information on students in this class for computing grades. We can create a new class of object called a “student”:\n",
    "\n",

    "**Overloading** refers to the ability to define new data or methods for a child class that \"overload\" the same data or methods of a parent class. A common coding pattern is to create a shared parent class for two or more children classes. The parent class defines a set of data and methods which are either not implemented at all (referred to as **virtual** method) or provide some default behavior. The child classes overload these methods to implement their own specializations. \n",
