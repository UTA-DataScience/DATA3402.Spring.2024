    "* *Game Display:* we have represented the game in memory, but that represetation is difficult to visually process. We will write a function that takes a game board and nicely writes it out to the display.\n",

A natural representation of the board is a matrix, where every element corresponds to a square on the board. We choose a convention that the square is empty when corresponding matrix element is 0, and 1 or 2 when there is piece from player 1 or 2, respectively, in the box. \n",
